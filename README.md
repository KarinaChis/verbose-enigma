# Welcome to my Experimental Expo App ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal Expo app, where I explore and experiment with different React Native libraries, features, and integrations. I use it to test new tools, UI components, performance optimizations, offline capabilities, and other React Native-related technologies.

Some of the things Iâ€™ve tried in this app include:
â€¢ URQL â€“ A lightweight and flexible GraphQL client for managing API requests.
â€¢ MSW (Mock Service Worker) â€“ A powerful tool for intercepting and mocking API requests, useful for both unit and integration testing.
â€¢ Maestro â€“ A fast and user-friendly framework for end-to-end testing in mobile applications.

This app serves as a sandbox for continuous learning and hands-on experience with new technologies in the React Native ecosystem.

## Get started (will be updated later on)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
